# DevSecOps Incident Response Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of automated incident response within a DevSecOps pipeline. The goal is to identify security incidents in real-time, automate responses to those incidents, and ensure continuous security and compliance in the development lifecycle.

## Features
- Continuous Security Monitoring
- Automated Incident Detection
- Automated Incident Response
- Logging and Alerting
- Compliance Checks

## Technologies and Tools
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- Security Tools: Trivy, Aqua Security, Falco, ELK Stack
- Scripting: Python, Bash
- Automation: Ansible, Terraform
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Incident Response: SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Wazuh)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
3. Configure Docker and build the images.
4. Set up security monitoring tools and configure logging.
5. Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform.
6. Run the Ansible playbooks for automated incident response.

## Usage
- Push code changes to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
- Monitor security incidents using the ELK stack and Prometheus.
- Respond to incidents automatically using Ansible playbooks.
